## 🏗️ Architecture

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Tab-Based Navigation**
- Primary navigation uses Expo Router's tab system
- Each major feature (Weather, Forecast, Charts, Settings) has its own tab
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated screens

#### 2. **Context-Based State Management**
- `WeatherContext` provides global state for weather data
- Centralized API calls and error handling
- Automatic refresh intervals with user-configurable rates

#### 3. **Service Layer Architecture**
- Separate services for different APIs and functionalities
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- API request logging for monitoring and debugging

#### 4. **Adaptive Theming System**
- Dynamic themes based on weather conditions and time of day
- Consistent color schemes across all components
- Accessibility-compliant contrast ratios

#### 5. **Component-Based UI**
- Reusable components with consistent styling
- Platform-specific optimizations for iOS, Android, and Web
- Responsive design with proper breakpoints

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- API keys (see Environment Setup below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd WeatherMonitor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CAIYUN_API_KEY=your_caiyun_api_key_here
   ```

   **Getting API Keys:**
   
   - **OpenWeatherMap API**: 
     1. Visit [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
     2. Sign up for a free account
     3. Generate an API key from your dashboard
     4. Free tier includes 1,000 calls/day
   
   - **Caiyun API** (for weather alerts):
     1. Visit [caiyunapp.com](https://caiyunapp.com/api)
     2. Register for an account
     3. Get your API token
     4. Used for weather alerts and warnings

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the app**
   - **Web**: Open the provided localhost URL in your browser
   - **Mobile**: Scan the QR code with Expo Go app
   - **Simulator**: Press `i` for iOS or `a` for Android

### Building for Production

#### Web Deployment
```bash
npm run build:web
```
The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

#### Mobile App Builds
For mobile app builds, you'll need to use EAS Build:

1. **Install EAS CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Configure EAS**
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build for iOS/Android**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform all
   ```

## 📊 Data Sources

### Primary Weather Data: OpenWeatherMap API

**Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /weather` - Current weather conditions
- `GET /forecast` - 5-day weather forecast with 3-hour intervals

**Data Includes:**
- Temperature (current, feels-like, min/max)
- Weather conditions and descriptions
- Humidity, pressure, visibility
- Wind speed and direction
- Sunrise/sunset times
- Geographic coordinates

**Rate Limits:**
- Free tier: 1,000 calls/day, 60 calls/minute
- Paid tiers available for higher usage

### Weather Alerts: Caiyun API

**Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /weather?alert=true` - Weather alerts and warnings

**Alert Data Includes:**
- Alert severity levels (red, orange, yellow, blue)
- Alert types (thunderstorm, heavy rain, snow, etc.)
- Geographic coverage areas
- Start and end times
- Detailed descriptions in multiple languages

**Coverage:**
- Primarily covers China and surrounding regions
- Real-time government weather warnings
- Multiple severity classifications

### Location Services

**Data Sources:**
- **Mobile**: Native GPS via Expo Location

**Reverse Geocoding:**
- City name resolution from coordinates
- Country and region information
- Timezone detection

## 🔧 Configuration

### App Settings

Users can configure:
- **Auto-refresh rate**: 5 minutes to 2 hours
- **Dark/Light mode**: Manual toggle or automatic based on time
- **Notification preferences**: Enable/disable weather alerts

- **User preference**: Manual dark/light mode override
- **Seasonal adjustments**: Subtle variations based on weather patterns

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New Screens**: Add files to `app/(tabs)/` directory
2. **Components**: Create reusable components in `components/`
3. **API Services**: Extend services in `services/` directory
4. **Types**: Update TypeScript interfaces in `types/`

### Testing

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Platform-Specific Code

Use Platform.select() for platform-specific implementations:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: { shadowColor: '#000' },
      android: { elevation: 4 },
      web: { boxShadow: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)' },
    }),
  },
});
```

## 📱 Supported Platforms
